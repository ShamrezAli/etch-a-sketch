Creating an etch-a-sketch program to solidify my JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills.

The goal of this project was to ensure that I am able to use the DOM effectively and consistently to complete projects. I first set out to generate a square containing a grid of divs matching a number inputted. If a 5 was entered, a 5x5 grid would generate, and so on to 100 maximum. Working with the grid forming function to calculate a correct value to be square was the main challenge here.

From there, the grids needed to change colour with a mouse hover. Touch screens were not the focus for this project. 

Once complete, the project succeeds at being a grid drawing tool that allows for the generation of squares from 2x2 to 100x100.
